# Intro
These are all my files that I use for workflow and beauty, hopefully you can find something that can be used in here :)

# Scripts
## Dwm status
Give pc hardware status, current settings and time to dwms' bar
## Xlight
Changes brightness for all displays using the first brightness found in xrandr query as a base

# Unix utility configs
Need to have nerd-fonts installed for bash and vim
## Bashrc
For bash sets up prompt for console and x11, changing functions, and a couple nice shortcuts
## Dunst
Sets notification visuals and functionality
## Picom
Set opacity, fade, and blur, also gives rounded edges to windows
## Vimrc
Sets up functionality, visuals, colors, and statusline for vim
## Xinitrc
Setup x server to fit monitor resolution, launch picom, use unclutter to hide mouse quicker, set random wallpaper, and then launches my desktop enviroment (obviously)

## Dwm/st configs
Configs for the suckless DE and term, insert in dir of source with same ver and patches applied as in the file, compile, and will be good to go
### dwm
Besides some of the normal changes like colors and fonts, the workflow with this relies on the use of having one key to switch between two layouts (tiled/monocle) and swapping between two monitors instead of using regular tabs
### st
Main changes here are the usage of vim like keys to scroll and zoom, opacity, and personalized colors
